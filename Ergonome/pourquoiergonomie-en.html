      "I cannot live personally without my art. But I have never placed this art above everything. If it is necessary for me, on the contrary, it is because it does not separate itself from anyone and allows me to live, as I am, on the same level as everybody."
      <br> <small><i>Discours de Suède, in Essais, op. cit. p. 1071,
            Albert Camus </i> </small>

As I entered my thirties, I began to think more and more about the impact my life would have in the world and the kind of contribution I would like to make to society. We spend a large part of our lives working, and ergonomists work to make workers' lives easier. Through this career, I have the opportunity to help people in their everyday lives, and I really enjoy this mission.</p>
