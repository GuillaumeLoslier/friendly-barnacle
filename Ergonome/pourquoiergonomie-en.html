<br>
<p>Ergonomics is a little-known discipline. When people ask me what it is, I say that I try to improve people's working conditions by analyzing their work situations in order to better understand what they do and to propose transformations. but this is a somewhat incomplete definition. I suggest this one, taken from the book <i>L'intervention en ergonomie</i> (St-Vincent et al., 2011):</p>

<p>
  "Ergonomics produces and mobilizes knowledge on the activity of the person at work with a view to improving work situations by acting on its various components (the technical device, the physical environment, the organization of work, the organization of the production of goods or services and the organization of training and learning conditions). Its contribution lies of course in the elaboration of knowledge, but also in the use and development of methods aimed at better understanding and anticipating the main characteristics of the work activity in order to take them into consideration in the design and transformation choices of work situations. Its field of expertise encompasses an approach to the analysis of human activity and the design of work situations, in interaction with all the actors involved, to improve both the health and safety of workers and the effectiveness and quality of production systems for goods or services, with a view to organizational efficiency.""

As I entered my thirties, I began to think more and more about the impact my life would have in the world and the kind of contribution I would like to make to society. We spend a large part of our lives working, and ergonomists work to make workers' lives easier. Through this career, I have the opportunity to help people in their everyday lives, and I really enjoy this mission.</p>
